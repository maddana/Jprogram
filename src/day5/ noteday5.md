* IF VARIABLE IS FINAL THEN IT WILL BE CONSTANT


## ABSTRACT

*  Function which have method but no definition.
*  Object can't be created because there is no definition.	
* To implement RunTime Polymorphism we  use abstract class.

## TRANSIENT

* It is applicable in C Realizations.
* APPLICABLE FOR VARIABLES THAT CAN'T BE SERIALISED
## Native

*	Methods present in the library we are using directly they are called Native

## Strictfp

* Strict floating point.
<br>
* If inner class is defined static then it is nested class.
<br>
<p> </p>
## POJO
* A class that allows to access the data is called pojo or java bean.
* 
## ENTERPRISE JAVA OR BUSINESS JAVA

The class which have only logic part.

## Encapsulation

* The data is hidden to the users
