### Destructor

````````java
We can have only one constructor for each class.

It works as a before garbage collector.

if an object in a program is created then object is allocated some memory with new.(Class object =new Class())  

Since the object is allocated memory if we are not using that object the memory will be wasted 

So destructor is used to remove the memory allocated for the object.

There is no default destructor.
